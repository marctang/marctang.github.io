    abstract = "{Humans categorize the experience they encounter in various ways, which is mirrored, for instance, in grammatical gender systems of languages. In such systems, nouns are grouped based on whether they refer to masculine/feminine beings, (non-)humans, (in)animate entities, or objects with specific shapes. Languages differ greatly in how many gender assignment rules are incorporated in gender systems and how many word classes carry gender marking (gender agreement patterns). It has been suggested that these two dimensions are positively associated as numerous assignment rules are better sustained by numerous agreement patterns. We test this claim by analyzing the correlated evolution (Continuous method in BayesTraits) and making the causal inferences about the relationships (phylogenetic path analysis) between these 2 dimensions in 482 languages from the global Grambank database. By applying these methods to linguistic data matched to phylogenetic trees (a world tree and individual families), we evaluate whether various types of gender assignment rules (semantic, phonological, and unpredictable) are causally linked to more gender agreement patterns on the global level and in individual language families. Our results on the world language tree suggest that semantic rules are weakly positively correlated with gender agreement and that the development of agreement patterns is facilitated by different rules in individual families. For example, in Indo-European languages, more agreement patterns are caused by the presence of phonological and unpredictable rules, while in Bantu languages, the driving force of agreement patterns is the variety of semantic rules. Our study shows that the relationships between agreement and rules are family-specific and yields support to the idea that more distinct rules and/or rule types might be more robust in languages with more pervasive gender agreement.}",

These observations suggest that the Altaic classifier systems are not indigenous. Based on the Single Origin Hypothesis that Chinese is the only language with an indigenous classifier system in Eurasia, we propose that the rise of classifiers in Altaic is due to the influence of neighboring classifier languages. Having first confirmed that the putative classifiers in these 15 languages are genuine classifiers, we then examine the phonological and semantic characteristics of the classifiers identified in each language and detect the influence from either Chinese or Persian. Taking historical and geographical factors into consideration, we suggest that classifier languages east of Uyghur were influenced by Chinese, while those to the west are influenced by Persian; Uyghur itself was influenced by both. Assuming that Persian classifiers are not indigenous either, these findings suggest that the Single Origin Hypothesis is applicable to classifier languages in Altaic.}",

    abstract = "{Grammatical gender in New Guinea is an often neglected area in typological research, even though it is extremely diverse. For example, in New Guinea, some languages have grammatical gender systems with two sex-based categories, more than four gender-indexing targets, and no gender marking on nouns, while some languages have grammatical gender systems with much more categories, which are only marginally sex-based. This paper infers the processes of development and change of grammatical gender in Torricelli languages from two perspectives. First, it synthesizes the available data in the existing literature and hypothesizes the evolutionary pathway of gender systems in Torricelli languages. Nineteen Torricelli languages are selected as a representative coverage of the 55 Torricelli languages listed in Glottolog within the limits of the available documentation. These languages are then coded based on 6 presence-absence features relating to gender marking on verbs, adjectives, nouns, numerals, pronouns, and demonstratives. Second, it conducts an analysis with phylogenetic comparative methods to provide a quantitative assessment of the evolutionary possibilities for gender systems in Torricelli languages. The preliminary results show that gender is likely marked at the root of Torricelli languages, with pronouns and verbs being at the core of the system. This is in agreement with trends reflecting the evolution of gender systems in languages across the world.}",

While previous studies have highlighted the role of network structure in language change, the specific aspects of network structure that shape language variability remain largely unknown. To address this gap, we developed a Bayesian agent-based model of language evolution, contrasting between two distinct scenarios: language change and language emergence. By isolating the relative effects of specific global network metrics across thousands of simulations, we show that global characteristics of network structure play a critical role in shaping interindividual variation in language, while intraindividual variation is relatively unaffected. We effectively challenge the long-held belief that size and density are the main network structural factors influencing language variation, and show that path length and clustering coefficient are the main factors driving interindividual variation. In particular, we show that variation is more likely to occur in populations where individuals are not well-connected to each other. Additionally, variation is more likely to emerge in populations that are structured in small communities. Our study provides potentially important insights into the theoretical mechanisms underlying language variation.}",

abstract = { The research aims to conduct a corpus-based and data-driven analysis of the early-stage Mandarin learning production of 11 Thai preschool children in Bangkok, Thailand, within the interlanguage system. These children consist of 8 boys and 3 girls, with an age range of 4;1-6;5 (M = 5.455, SD = 0.688; total tokens = 36,565). Data were extracted from a spoken corpus constructed between 2018 and 2022, which was time-stamped, phone-aligned, and multi-tiered using Praat [P. Boersma and D. Weenink, Praat: Doing phonetics by computer (2022), http://www.praat.org/]. The data were annotated and labeled through a semi-automatic process employing various applications in Hybrid-DNN-HMM. The findings indicate the following: (1) Most sound deviations in learning do not mirror the phonetic inventory of L1; (2) Sound deviations can be influenced by L2, with marked phones exhibiting more deviations between L1 and L2; (3) Interlanguage manifests as a self-organizing and self-adaptive system. The study delves into the Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis, Markedness Differential Hypothesis and Interlanguage theory. It compares data with cross-linguistic universal trends in Mandarin acquisition and spoken corpus in Mandarin adults. Segmental similarities regarding phonological distances are quantitatively measured through Levenshtein edit distance and Hamming distance based on multivalued distinctive features.},

This conclusion has been based on feature-value analyses of the inflected forms, and definitions of natural classes that are theoretically driven and about which no consensus exists. Individual examples of morphomes are thus frequently challenged, while their autonomously morphological nature has never been tested quantitatively or experimentally. This is the purpose of the present study. We use context-based embeddings to explore the semantic profile of Spanish verb stem alternations. At the paradigmatic level, our findings suggest that Spanish morphomes’ cells are characterized by significantly above-chance distributional-semantic similarity. At the lexical level, similarly, verbs that show more similar patterns of alternation have also been found to be closer in meaning. Both of these findings suggest that these structures may have an extramorphological function. Using gradient distributional-semantic similarity offers a way to objectively assess the degree of (un)naturalness of a set of forms and meanings, something which has been lacking from most discussions on the structure of features and the architecture of paradigms.}",

	abstract = {Like all modern Romance languages, French has a sex-based grammatical gender with two genders, feminine and masculine, and a lexicon that is highly sex-differentiated. These characteristics give rise to a number of issues, including the problematic generic use of the masculine grammatical gender, coupled with the challenge of sex categorization itself, and the epistemological difficulty of an adequate sociological description and analysis of what gender commonsense categories really are about. To remedy these concerns, several authors have proposed the creation of an additional, epicene grammatical gender. We have identified three such systematic proposals, or solutions, which specify various morphological options for new epicene nouns and gender markers on their satellite elements. These options include the use of non-standard or rarely used characters, the merging of feminine and masculine gender markers, as well as consonantal and vowel changes. In the simplest proposal, referred to as “solution I,” new epicene forms are mostly derived from feminine forms by systematically replacing with an i the final e that generally differentiates feminines from their masculine counterparts in written French. Although these solutions are used in some communities, their learnability has not been addressed so far, even though it could be a determining factor in their popularity and their eventual integration into standard French. In the present study, we provide a first assessment of this aspect by means of an online translation test. For each solution, French-speaking participants were instructed that they would be trained to learn an “alien” language that does not mark sex/gender categories (these alien languages correspond to standard French where only gendered words referring to people are replaced by the new epicene forms recommended by each solution). After a short learning-by-example phase, participants were required to translate into the alien language a set of 16 standard French sentences. The translations were analyzed as a function of several variables including the participants’ self-reported age and sex, the word categories and the solutions themselves. While all solutions proved quickly learnable, participants’ responses with solution I achieved the highest accuracy score, in particular with regard to the production of non-standard epicene forms.},

For example, speech errors are less likely to occur with high-frequency words since these words already receive a high level of activation. The current analysis further develops existing findings in two ways. First, instead of considering the overall frequency of the words in the entire corpora, we consider the gap in frequency between sequential pairs of words. We hypothesize that speech errors are more likely to occur if the target has a much lower frequency than its preceding word. Second, we use word embedding methods to quantify the semantic distance between sequential pairs of words. We hypothesize that speech errors are more likely to occur with words that have a large semantic distance from their preceding context. We also consider the potential effects of phonetic distance between sequential pairs of words and position-in-utterance of words in utterances. The results from a Mandarin corpus of speech errors show that word frequency and semantic distance between sequential pairs of words can be used to predict the occurrence of speech errors with an accuracy above the majority baseline.},

abstract = {This article presents the first study on reflexive expressions having lexicalized an emotional meaning, as in the English example enjoy oneself. Such lexicalized forms, which we call ‘reflexemes’, occur in a number of genetically unrelated languages worldwide. Here we interrogate the cross-linguistic distribution and semantics of reflexemes, based on a sample of 58 languages from 6 genetic groups throughout Europe, Australia, and Asia. Reflexemes exhibit uneven distribution in this sample. Despite the presence of reflexemes across all three continents, European languages generally display much larger inventories. Based on our language sample’s contrasts, we hypothesize that these disparities could be driven by: the form of reflexive markers; their semantic range, including colexifications with anticausative constructions; and their longevity, with ancient, cognate European markers fostering accumulation of reflexemes via inheritance and borrowing. As for semantics, reflexemes target comparable emotions across languages. Specifically, categories labelled ‘Good feelings’, ‘Anger’, ‘Worry’, ‘Bad feelings’ and ‘Fear’ are consistently most prevalent. These tendencies apply across our sample, with no sign of family- or continent-specific semantic tendency. The observed semantic distribution may reflect universal lexicalization tendencies not specific to reflexemes, perhaps combined with an emphasis on self-evaluation and other social emotions imparted by reflexive semantics.},

Cross-linguistically, a numeral that involves a multiplier and a numeral base can be base-final, e.g., three hundred [three × hundred] in English, or base-initial, e.g., ikie ita [hundred × three] in Ibibio (Niger-Congo). A worldwide survey of 4099 languages reveals that 39% of the languages are base-initial, 48% are base-final, 4% use both orders, and 8% are without numeral bases. As the first step towards explaining this diversity and worldwide distribution, we offer convergent evidence to support the hypothesis that the languages of early humans in Africa had base-initial numerals. From a linguistic point of view, linearization is necessary for the verbal expression of multiplicative numerals. Between the two linear orders of multiplication, we demonstrate that the base-initial order has an initial advantage in communicative efficiency. We also offer typological evidence from the dominant head-initial word order in present-day numeral systems and nominal phrases in African languages. Finally, results from a phylogenetic analysis based on a global tree of human languages show that the base-initial order is more stable diachronically and more likely to be at the root of the reconstructed tree of languages in Africa between 100 and 150 thousand years ago. The dominant base-final order in non-African languages of modernity is thus likely to be a development after the Out-of-Africa exodus between 60 and 80 thousand years ago.},

The interactive model predicts a small semantic and phonological distance between the target and the response words, whereas the cascade model predicts that the responses are semantically close to the targets but are phonologically far from the targets. One hundred forty-five stimuli tested with 22 participants resulted in 2289 tokens available for testing. The phonological and semantic distances were automatically measured using Levenshtein distance and word embeddings; additional metadata over 10M drawn from the Academia Sinica Corpus in Taiwan was computed. The results show that the stimuli and the responses are closer than random semantically and phonologically, supporting the predictions from the interactive models. However, we also observe that the semantic distance is shorter than the phonological distance. A concomitant increase in chronometry is found with longer semantic distance.},

This volume proposes to fill in a gap in existing research by focusing on Asia, based on case studies from languages belonging to a wide range of families, i.e., Austroasiatic, Austronesian, Dravidian, Hmong-Mien, Indo-European, Mongolic, Sino-Tibetan and Tai-Kadai as well as the language isolate Nivkh. Gender and classifiers in these languages are approached within several different perspectives, i.e., functional, typological and diachronic, thus revealing complex patterns in their lexical and pragmatic functions as well as origin, development and loss. Describing and analysing such properties is a unique and innovative contribution of the volume.},

Assamese represents an insightful example of an Indo-European language relying on classifiers rather than grammatical gender to fulfill the functions typical for a nominal classification system. Our analysis shows that classifiers in Assamese behave similarly to other classifier languages in terms of lexical and discourse functions, except for the functions of definiteness marking and individuation. The implications of such findings are connected to typology, research in human cognition, and language contact.},

Word order variability should be regarded as a basic assumption, rather than as something exceptional. Although this approach follows naturally from the emergentist usage-based view of language, we argue that it can be beneficial for all frameworks and linguistic domains, including language acquisition, processing, typology, language contact, language evolution and change, and formal approaches. Gradient approaches have been very fruitful in some domains, such as language processing, but their potential is not fully realized yet. This may be due to practical reasons. We discuss the most pressing methodological challenges in corpus-based and experimental research of word order and propose some practical solutions.},

	abstract = {French is a language spoken by hundreds of millions of speakers in Europe, Africa, and America. Such widespread use favours variation, yet large homogeneous corpora allowing to account for this variation worldwide are scarce and would in any case necessitate non-negligeable financial and human resources, as did for instance the project Phonologie du Français Contemporain. In this study, we present a possible alternative – crowdsourcing. We introduce Lingua Libre, Wikimedia’s open linguistic library, and use it to describe the variation of a phonemic opposition between two low vowels, /a/ and /ɑ/, in several varieties of French. The recordings of 38 speakers from 26 survey points are processed automatically and compared to values from past research. Results show that the platform has the potential to provide results mostly congruent with those of professional field recordings. The study concludes on the advantages and limitations of the platform and proposes suggestions for its improvement.}

However, in synchrony, the formal accounts for the DM class vary from purely discourse-oriented definitions to models relying on a combination of lexico-grammatical and discursive information. We propose to bring new evidence into this debate by comparing the phonetic realizations of 4 DM types: stemming originally from adverbs, coordinators, subordinators and interjections. A discourse-only account would predict that the 4 types would be realized similarly, while a syntactic-discursive account predicts that subordinators would stand out, as they are less prone to syntactic independence. The analysis of various acoustic parameters (segment duration, F0, F1, F2 and HNR) in a finely-annotated 4-hour long corpus of French indicates that a hybrid approach may indeed be more accurate.}

Fricatives exhibit important aperiodic energy, which can extend over a high-frequency range beyond that conventionally considered in phonetic analyses, often limited up to 12 kHz. We adopt here an extended frequency range up to 20.05 kHz to study a corpus of 15 812 fricatives produced by 59 speakers in Russian, a language offering a rich inventory of fricatives. We extracted two sets of parameters: the first is composed of 11 parameters derived from the frequency spectrum and duration (acoustic set) while the second is composed of 13 mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). As a first step, we implemented machine learning methods to evaluate the potential of each set to predict gender and speaker identity. We show that gender can be predicted with a good performance by the acoustic set and even more so by MFCCs (accuracy of 0.72 and 0.88, respectively). MFCCs also predict individuals to some extent (accuracy = 0.64) unlike the acoustic set. In a second step, we provide a detailed analysis of the observed intra- and inter-speaker acoustic variation.},

Such a rare co-occurrence of different nominal classification systems is highly relevant for investigating linguistic complexity, as languages generally do not have several systems of the same type fulfilling the same functions. However, no corpus-based quantitative analyses have been conducted on the productive use of nominal classification systems in Nepali. The current paper aims at filling this gap by providing a token-based study from the Nepali National Corpus (∼20 million words). Our preliminary results show that there is in fact little formal overlap between the classifier and the gender systems.},

Quantitative testing in three Niger-Congo language families},
	issn = {2822-7468},
	pdf = {https://journals.openedition.org/lla/4615},
	abstract = {The noncausal/causal alternation is the pairing of two verb forms that refer to the same core event but differ in the absence vs. presence of a causer for this event (e.g. rise vs. raise, open (intr.) vs. open (tr.), die vs. kill). Languages differ in their overall preferences among the possible strategies for coding this alternation. This study uses machine-learning methods (clustering and tree-based computational classifiers) to investigate the predictive power of the noncausal/causal alternation for the genealogical affiliation of 38 languages belonging to the Atlantic, Mande and Mel families. The languages studied here belong to different contact areas in Senegal and its surroundings. The three families are all affiliated to the Niger-Congo phylum but display quite different typological profiles. The present paper elaborates on an earlier study that used a standard list of 18 verb pairs to establish the coding strategies in these languages. Apart from highlighting which coding strategies are favored in each family, our quantitative analyses show that the family affiliation of the 38 languages can be predicted with an accuracy above the majority baseline based on the information of the noncausal/causal alternation in the 18 verb pairs, but that the predictive power of verb pairs 1‑9 is generally lower than the one of verb pairs 10‑18. Our results confirm the hypothesis that the first group of verb pairs shows universal rather than lineage-specific tendencies concerning the noncausal/causal alternation. Furthermore, our analyses identify which of the 18 verb pairs (and their correlated coding strategies) have the highest predictive power. This study opens new avenues for identifying the relevant synchronic data for genealogical classification in historical linguistics. Future studies could replicate the same analysis in different language families to assess if our results are universal or specific to some language families.},

Taiwanese universities base their policies solely on the credit fail rate (CFR) of individual semesters (S-CFR). The most common S-CFR is 50\% and is called er-yi (two-one), which indicates half or more of the course credits of a semester were failed. Though actual policies vary among universities, their core designs generally rely on the concept of S-CFR. The present study first compares the dismissal policies among universities in the United States, the Netherlands, and Taiwan to demonstrate how the two–one design lacks consultation and review processes. We then argue that the disregard for cumulative grade point average, semester grade point average, and cumulative credit pass rate may lead to bias because it may lead to students with better overall academic performance being dismissed. We further validate the argument by conducting a quantitative analysis of data on the academic performance of students (N=22,703) from National Chengchi University over 11 years under four different policies. Our findings strongly indicate that the core design common in such policies, i.e., the S-CFR, should be reconsidered.},

	abstract = {The Nakh languages Chechen and Tsova-Tush each have a five-valued gender system: masculine, feminine, and three “neuter” genders named for their singular agreement forms: B, D and J. Gender assignment in languages is generally analysed as being dependent on both forms and semantics (e.g. Corbett, 1991), with semantics typically prevailing over form (e.g. Bellamy \&amp; Wichers Schreur, 2021, Allassonnière-Tang et al., 2021). Most previous studies have considered only binary or tripartite gender systems possessing masculine, feminine, and neuter values. The five-valued system of Nakh thus represents an innovative and insightful case study for analysing gender assignment. In this paper we build on the existing qualitative linguistic analyses of gender assignment in Tsova-Tush (Wichers Schreur, 2021) and apply three machine-learning methods to investigate the weight of form and semantics in predicting grammatical gender in Chechen and Tsova-Tush. The results show that while both form and semantics are helpful for predicting grammatical gender in Nakh, semantics is dominant, which supports findings from existing literature (Allassonnière-Tang, Brown \&amp; Fedden, 2021). However, the results also show that the coded semantic information could be further fine-grained to improve the accuracy of the predictions (see also Plaster et al., 2013). In addition, we discuss the implications of the output for our understanding of language-internal and family-internal processes of language change, including how loanwords are integrated from Russian, a three-gender language.},

We investigate data from 10 languages with various numbers of vowel categories, i.e., German, Afrikaans, French, Catalan, Italian, Romanian, Polish, Russian, Spanish, and Basque. Audio files are extracted from Lingua Libre to be aligned and segmented using the Munich Automatic Segmentation System. Information on the formants of the vowel segments is then extracted to measure how vowels expand in the acoustic space and whether this is correlated with the number of vowel categories in the language.

Results show that the size of the inventory does not seem to influence vowel production, thus supporting previous research, but also that the shape of the inventory may well be a factor determining the extent of variation in vowel production.

This convergence is often explained by horizontal diffusibility, which is typically ascribed to language contact. In such a scenario, speakers of two or more languages interact and influence each other’s languages, and in this interaction, more grammaticalized features tend to be more resistant to diffusion compared to features of more lexical content. An alternative explanation is vertical heritability: languages in proximity often share genealogical descent. Here, we suggest that the geographic distribution of features globally can be explained by two major pathways, which are generally not distinguished within quantitative typological models: feature diffusion and language expansion. The first pathway corresponds to the contact scenario described above, while the second occurs when speakers of genetically related languages migrate. We take the worldwide distribution of nominal classification systems (grammatical gender, noun class, and classifier) as a case study to show that more grammaticalized systems, such as gender, and less grammaticalized systems, such as classifiers, are almost equally widespread, but the former spread more by language expansion historically, whereas the latter spread more by feature diffusion. Our results indicate that quantitative models measuring the areal diffusibility and stability of linguistic features are likely to be affected by language expansion that occurs by historical coincidence. We anticipate that our findings will support studies of language diversity in a more sophisticated way, with relevance to other parts of language, such as phonology.},

	abstract = {This paper shows that machine learning techniques are very successful at classifying the Russian voiceless non-palatalized fricatives [f], [s], and [ʃ] using a small set of acoustic cues. From a data sample of 6320 tokens of read sentences produced by 40 participants, temporal and spectral measurements are extracted from the full sound, the noise duration, and the middle 30 ms windows. Furthermore, 13 mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are computed from the middle 30 ms window. Classifiers based on single decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks are trained and tested to distinguish between these three fricatives. The results demonstrate that, first, the three acoustic cue extraction techniques are similar in terms of classification accuracy (93\% and 99\%) but that the spectral measurements extracted from the full frication noise duration result in slightly better accuracy. Second, the center of gravity and the spectral spread are sufficient for the classification of [f], [s], and [ʃ] irrespective of contextual and speaker variation. Third, MFCCs show a marginally higher predictive power over spectral cues (<2\%). This suggests that both sets of measures provide sufficient information for the classification of these fricatives and their choice depends on the particular research question or application.},

In this paper we report two psycholinguistic experiments on speech production and perception in Mandarin to investigate this branching issue. First, we applied the syntax-phonology interface of tone 3 (T3) sandhi and performed a phonological analysis of native speakers' tone sandhi patterns of [Num C/M N] phrases composed of T3 monosyllabic words. Second, we conducted a click-detection experiment to see how native speakers would perceive a click inserted in a C/M phrase composed of monosyllabic words, as compared to when it is inserted in other syntactic structures with attested left or right-branching. Results from both experiments supported the leftbranching structure of classifier phrases.},

	abstract = {Relationships between phonological and morphological complexity have long been proposed in the linguistic literature, with empirical investigations often seeking complexity trade-offs. Positive complexity correlations tend not to be viewed in terms of motivations. We argue that positive complexity correlations can be diachronically well-motivated, emerging from crosslinguistically prevalent processes of language change. We examine the correlation between syllable complexity and morphological synthesis, hypothesizing that the process of grammaticalization motivates a positive relationship between the two features. To test this, we conduct a typological survey of 95 diverse languages and a corpus study of 21 languages with substantive (predominantly {\textgreater}10,000 words) corpora from the DoReCo project. The first study establishes a significant positive correlation between syllable complexity, measured in terms of maximal syllable patterns, and the index of synthesis (morpheme/word ratio). The second study tests the hypothesis that the relationship between syllable complexity and synthesis holds at local (word-initial and word-final) levels and within noun and verb types, as predicted by a grammaticalization account. While the findings of the corpus study are limited in their statistical power, the observed tendencies are consistent with our predictions. This study contributes important findings to the complexity literature, as well as a novel method which incorporates broad typological sampling and deep corpus analysis.},

	abstract = {The Trans-New Guinea language Mian has a four-valued gender system that has been analyzed in detail as semantic. This means that the principles of gender assignment are based on the meaning of the noun. Languages with purely semantic systems are at one end of a spectrum of possible assignment types, while others are assumed to have both semantic and formal (i.e., phonologyor morphology-based) assignment. Given the possibility of gender assignment by both semantic and formal principles, it is worthwhile testing the empirical validity of the categorization of the Mian system as predominantly semantic. Here, we apply three machine learning models to determine independently what role semantics and phonology play in predicting Mian gender. Information about the formal and semantic features of nouns is extracted automatically from a dictionary. Different types of computational classifiers are trained to predict the grammatical gender of nouns, and the performance of the computational classifiers is used to assess the relevance of form and semantics in relation to gender prediction. The results show that semantics is dominant in predicting the gender of nouns in Mian. While it validates the original analysis of the Mian system, it also provides further evidence that claims of an equal contribution of form-based and semantic features in gender assignment do not hold for at least a proper subset of languages with gender.},

	abstract = {Treating the speech communities as homogeneous entities is not an accurate representation of reality, as it misses some of the complexities of linguistic interactions. Inter-individual variation and multiple types of biases are ubiquitous in speech communities, regardless of their size. This variation is often neglected due to the assumption that “majority rules,” and that the emerging language of the community will override any such biases by forcing the individuals to overcome their own biases, or risk having their use of language being treated as “idiosyncratic” or outright “pathological.” In this paper, we use computer simulations of Bayesian linguistic agents embedded in communicative networks to investigate how biased individuals, representing a minority of the population, interact with the unbiased majority, how a shared language emerges, and the dynamics of these biases across time. We tested different network sizes (from very small to very large) and types (random, scale-free, and small-world), along with different strengths and types of bias (modeled through the Bayesian prior distribution of the agents and the mechanism used for generating utterances: either sampling from the posterior distribution [“sampler”] or picking the value with the maximum probability [“MAP”]). The results show that, while the biased agents, even when being in the minority, do adapt their language by going against their a priori preferences, they are far from being swamped by the majority, and instead the emergent shared language of the whole community is influenced by their bias.},

We first provide a detailed analysis of the unconventional classifier system in Baoding. Then, we compare the lexical and discourse functions of sortal classifiers in Standard Mandarin and Baoding. We show that Standard Mandarin does present a certain level of convergence with its geographical neighbour Baoding.

The overarching theme is to analyse the involvement of the UK, the USA, and the UNHCR in different refugee cases that occurred during the 1970s. To do so, we (1) identify the main topics in each document; (2) investigate the transmission of topics horizontally (between organizations) and vertically (through time); and (3) suggest targeted areas of the document set for further close reading by historians. Standard Optical Character Recognition and object detection are used to extract information from documents and categorize them. Then, natural language processing (NLP) methods like topic modelling and clustering are used to identify topics and the relationships between them across time. The results identify several main themes covered by different organizations and how the focus of each organization changes diachronically. Besides its academic contribution, this study also demonstrates how, through the use of existing techniques with limited customization, digital technologies in the hands of the historian can augment and complement qualitative methods in bringing to light the themes and trends demonstrated in large bodies of historical documents.},

More precisely, we use decision trees and random forests to assess quantitatively the predictions of the phonological analysis. A manually annotated corpus of verbal paradigms was split into a training and a testing set. We trained the computational classifiers on the first and tested their predictions on the second. We found that they predict the majority of the patterns and support the qualitative analysis. Additionally, they suggest avenues for enhancing the phonological analysis, by providing a ranking of the variables that highlight statistical tendencies within tonal patterns. Besides its contribution to understanding tonal systems in general and of that of Yukuna in particular, our work also suggests that such machine learning approaches might become part of the complex theoretical and methodological toolkit needed for language description and linguistic theory development.},

The other hypothesis, formulated within the optimal gender assignment theory (Rice 2006), states that form and semantics contribute equally. Both hypotheses claim that the combination of formal and semantic features yields the most accurate gender identification. In this paper, we operationalize and test these hypotheses by trying to predict grammatical gender using only character-based embeddings (that capture only formal features), only context-based embeddings (that capture only semantic features) and the combination of both. We performed the experiment using data from three languages with different gender systems (French, German and Russian). Formal features are a significantly better predictor of gender than semantic ones, and the difference in prediction accuracy is very large. Overall, formal features are also significantly better than the combination of form and semantics, but the difference is very small and the results for this comparison are not entirely consistent across languages.},

Second, speech errors are more likely to occur near the end of utterances since, according to the given-before-new-principle, utterance-final words convey new information that has not yet been activated in the preceding context.

We use these two factors as explanatory variables to train the computational classifier of random forests and evaluate the accuracy of their predictive power when selecting the existence/absence of sortal classifiers as response variable. Our results show that these two factors result in an excellent discrimination performance of random forests, even when taking into account sortal classifiers as an areal feature. However, the correlation between morphosyntactic plural markers and multiplicative bases is weaker than the correlation between sortal classifiers and plural markers plus multiplicative bases. We are thus able to provide novel insights with regard to probabilistic universals on sortal classifiers, and suggest an innovative cross-disciplinary approach to test the effect of implicational universals with computational methods.},

In a typologically rare pattern, Nepali possesses two gender systems based on the human/non-human and masculine/feminine oppositions, in addition to which it has also developed an inventory of at least ten numeral classifiers as a result of contact with neighbouring Sino-Tibetan languages. Based on an analysis of the lexical and discourse functions of the three systems, we show that their functional contribution involves a largely complementary distribution of workload with respect to individual functions as well as the type of categorized nouns and referents. The study thus contributes to the ongoing discussions concerning the typology and functions of nominal classification as well as the effects of long-term language contact on language structure.},

We demonstrate that these grammatical gender systems share universal tendencies based on human cognition, i.e. associating long, thin, and vertical objects with masculine grammatical gender whereas round, flat, horizontal ones are associated with feminine grammatical gender. We also show that these grammatical gender systems distinguish between sociocultural values of the language speakers. Speakers of Hindi maintain a patrilineal kinship system, and in their language objects of large size are generally assigned to the masculine gender. Pnar kinship is matrilineal and in the language large sized objects tend to be associated with feminine gender. Similar asymmetries are observed with regard to generic gender and gender reversal. These results contribute to the impact of universal cognitive principles and culture on grammatical structures by showing that both tendencies are not necessarily complementary and that they can co-exist in the same language.},

Are all factors that influence gender assignment idiosyncratic to languages or are there any that are universal? Using cross-lingual aligned word embeddings, we perform two experiments to address these questions about language typology and human cognition. In both experiments, we predict the gender of nouns in language X using a classifier trained on the nouns of language Y, and take the classifier's accuracy as a measure of transferability of gender systems. First, we show that for 22 Indo-European languages the transferability decreases as the phylogenetic distance increases. This correlation supports the claim that some gender assignment factors are idiosyncratic, and as the languages diverge, the proportion of shared inherited idiosyncrasies diminishes. Second, we show that when the classifier is trained on two Afro-Asiatic languages and tested on the same 22 Indo-European languages (or vice versa), its performance is still significantly above the chance baseline, thus showing that universal factors exist and, moreover, can be captured by word embeddings. When the classifier is tested across families and on inanimate nouns only, the performance is still above baseline, indicating that the universal factors are not limited to biological sex.},

	abstract = {In a numeral classifier language, a sortal classifier (C) or a mensural classifier (M) is needed when a noun is quantified by a numeral (Num). Num and C/M are adjacent cross-linguistically, either in a [Num C/M] order or [C/M Num]. Likewise, in a complex numeral with a multiplicative composition, the
              base
              may follow the multiplier as in [
              n×base
              ], e.g.,
              san-bai
              ‘three hundred’ in Mandarin. However, the base may also precede the multiplier in some languages, thus [
              base×n
              ]. Interestingly, base and C/M seem to harmonize in word order, i.e., [

              base×n
              ] numerals, with [C/M Num]. This paper follows up on the explanation of the base-C/M harmonization based on the multiplicative theory of classifiers and verifies it empirically within six language groups in the world’s foremost hotbed of classifier languages: Sinitic, Miao-Yao, Austro-Asiatic, Tai-Kadai, Tibeto-Burman, and Indo-Aryan. Our survey further reveals two interesting facts: base-initial ([
              base×n
              ]) and C/M-initial ([C/M Num]) orders exist only in Tibeto-Burman (TB) within our dataset. Moreover, the few scarce violations to the base-C/M harmonization are also all in TB and are mostly languages having maintained their original base-initial numerals but borrowed from their base-final and C/M-final neighbors. We thus offer an explanation based on Proto-TB’s base-initial numerals and language contact with neighboring base-final, C/M-final languages.},

Morphosyntactic plurals engage in grammatical agreement outside the noun phrase, while morphosemantic plurals that relate to collective and associative marking do not. A database of 400 phylogenetically and geographically weighted languages was created to test this generalization. The statistical test of conditional inference trees was applied to investigate the effect of areal, phylogenetic, and linguistic factors on the distribution of classifiers and morphosyntactic plural markers. The results show that the presence of classifiers is affected by areal factors as most classifier languages are concentrated in Asia. Yet, the low ratio of languages with both features simultaneously is still statistically significant. Part (a) of the GSSG can thus be seen as a statistical universal. We then look into the few languages that do have both features and tentatively conclude that part (b) also seems to hold but further investigation into some of these languages is needed.},

	title = {A typology of classifiers and gender: {From} description to computation},
	abstract = {Categorization is one the most relevant tasks realized by humans during their life, as we consistently need to categorize the things and experience that we encounter. Such need is reflected in language via various mechanisms, the most prominent being nominal classification systems (e.g., grammatical gender such as the masculine/feminine distinction in French). Typological methods are used to investigate the underlying functions and structures of such systems, using a wide variety of cross-linguistic data to examine universality and variability. This analysis is itself a classification task, as languages are categorized and clustered according to their grammatical features. This thesis provides a cross-linguistic typological analysis of nominal classification systems and in parallel compares a number of quantitative methods that can be applied at different scales. First, this thesis provides an analysis of nominal classification systems (i.e., gender and classifiers) via the description of three languages with respectively gender, classifiers, and both. While the analysis of the first two languages are more of a descriptive nature and aligns with findings in the existing literature, the third language provides novel insights to the typology of nominal classification systems by demonstrating how classifiers and gender may co-occur in one language in terms of distribution of functions. Second, the underlying logic of nominal classification systems is commonly considered difficult to investigate, e.g., is there a consistent logic behind gender assignment in language? is it possible to explain the distribution of classifier languages of the world while taking into account geographical and genealogical effects? This thesis addresses the lack of arbitrariness of nominal classification systems at three different scales: The distribution of classifiers at the worldwide level, the presence of gender within a language family, and gender assignment at the language-internal level. The methods of random forests, phylogenetics, and word embeddings with neural networks are selected since they are respectively applicable at three different scales of research questions (worldwide, family-internal, language-internal).},

	abstract = {While nominal classification has received considerable attention, relatively little is known about cross-linguistically rare complex systems. An example is provided by Nepali (Indo-European, Indic), which possesses both grammatical gender and numeral classifiers. Our aim is to examine morphosyntactic and functional properties of the general classifier wota. Unusually, the classifier exhibits gender agreement both in its independent forms and as fused with a numeral, raising questions about its lexical and pragmatic functions. Our study contributes to the typology of nominal classification by proposing a functional approach to cases of complex co-occurrence of gender and classifiers.},

	abstract = {We provide theoretical explanation for the acquisition of numeral classifiers (sortal classifiers) and measure words (mensural classifiers) in Mandarin Chinese. Previous research in various languages separately observed that the general classifier is acquired before specific classifiers and that classifiers are acquired previous to measure words. However no theoretical discussion was fully developed and no study combined general classifier, specific classifiers and measure words in one dataset. We propose to fill these gaps by combining semantic complexity (Brown, 1973) and a mathematical approach (Her, 2012): given that the relative complexity of x, y and z is unknown, x + y is more complex than either x or y, and x + y + z is more complex than any of them. By applying the mathematical approach, it is observed that general classifier carries the mathematical value of times one, noted x, while specific classifiers posses x plus a semantic value of y, which highlights an inherent feature of the referent. Finally, measure words detain both x and y, along with a new information of quantity z. Therefore, the acquisition order is expected to start from the simplest semanticity and develop toward the most complex, i.e. general classifiers (x) > specific classifier (x+y)> measure word (x+y+z). As supporting evidence, we gathered longitudinal data from CHILDES (Child Language Data Exchange System; Zhou, 2008). The participants included 110 children from 1-6 years old, providing a total of 110 conversations of 20 minutes each with 1851 tokens of numeral classifiers and measure words. Our methodology applied the definition of acquisition from Brown (1973) and the equation of Suppliance in Obligatory Context (SOC) cross-checked with Target-Like Usage (TLU) from Pica (1983). The results demonstrated that our model generated correct prediction, serving as theoretical basis for future studies in the field of language acquisition.},
