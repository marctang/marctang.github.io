Title: International School in Linguistic Fieldwork.

FieldLing has been organised on a yearly basis since 2010 (involved units: LLACAN, SEDYL, LACITO, DDL). It is at present the only regular (and free) intensive training program in France preparing students to study theories, methods, and the use of technological tools for language description through fieldwork.

The webpage of the project can be found [here](https://fieldling.sciencesconf.org/?forward-action=index&forward-controller=index&lang=en).
