THIS WEBSITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

My academic background is in general linguistics, including topics such as syntax and phonology. I worked in the computer industry (ASUS) before coming back to academia. I developed along the way (and I am also still developing) skills in quantitative computational typology and in linguistics to investigate and/or develop existing linguistic hypotheses in terms of synchrony and diachrony. 

My current research involves nominal classification systems, such as the masculine/feminine distinction in French or the shape-based classifiers in Mandarin. The main aim of my research is to explain the worldwide diversity and distribution of such systems. This involves analyzing 'what is their definition', 'why they are found in some languages and not others', 'what is their function', 'how are their categories constructed', and 'how do they interact with the sociocultural and the cognitive systems'.
